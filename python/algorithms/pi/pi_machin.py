"""
In 1706 John Machin came up with the first really fast method of calculating π 
and used it to calculate π to 100 decimal places. Quite an achievement considering 
he did that entirely with pencil and paper. Machin's formula is:
    
    π/4 = 4cot⁻¹(5) - cot⁻¹(239)
        = 4tan⁻¹(1/5) - tan⁻¹(1/239)
        = 4 * arctan(1/5) - arctan(1/239)
